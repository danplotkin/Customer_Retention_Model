# Customer_Retention_Model

In telecommunications, a big part of customer relationship management involves efforts to retain existing customers. In many cases, the costs incurred to attract new customers are much larger than the costs to retain the existing customers.

In this project, I will use R to demonstrate a Data Scientist in the Telecommunication industry would create model to predict whether an existing customer will churn in the future or not. With this data, I will also create reccomondations that a Data Scientist would make to help keep customers around longer who are planning to churn.
